//waterproof

<p class=\"article-body\">While waterproof smartphones have been the norm in many Asian countries for some time, it's still a relatively novel concept in the UK. Sony was first out the blocks with its 2013 Xperia Z. Samsung and Apple followed suit. But there's a significant difference between waterproof and water-resistant and that's where IP ratings come in.</p><h2 class=\"article-sidetitle\">What is an IP rating?</h2><p class=\"article-body\">An IP (Ingress Protection) rating tells users exactly how waterproof a product is. The standard was drawn up by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) – a global organisation responsible for setting international standards for electronic devices, including everything from plug points to cameras, portable speakers and smartphones.<p class=\"article-body\">Each IP rating includes two digits, for example, IP67 or IP68 – two of the most common ratings currently found on portable devices including the iPhone 7and Samsung Galaxy S8.</p><h2 class=\"article-sidetitle\">Protection against solids</h2><p class=\"article-body\">An IP (Ingress Protection) rating tells users exactly how waterproof a product is. The standard was drawn up by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) – a global organisation responsible for setting international standards for electronic devices, including everything from plug points to cameras, portable speakers and smartphones.<p class=\"article-body\">Each IP rating includes two digits, for example, IP67 or IP68 – two of the most common ratings currently found on portable devices including the iPhone 7and Samsung Galaxy S8.</p><p class=\"article-body\">The first of the two digits (the 6 in IP67) refers to protection against solids, including dust. Products are rated using a 0-6 scale, with 6 being the most well protected. Here's what each level means:</p></p><ul class=\"article-list\"><li>0 - No protection.</li><li>1 - Protection against objects up to 50mm. Also, protection against any large surface of the body, such as the back of the hand, but no protection against deliberate contact with a body part.</li><li>2 - Protection against objects up to 12.5mm, along with fingers or similar objects.</li><li>3 - Protection against objects up to 2.5mm, such as thick wires or tools.</li><li>4 - Protection against objects up to 1mm, including most wires and screws.</li><li>5 - Not entirely protected from dust, but enough to significantly affect performance significant damage.</li><li>6 - Totally protected against dust.</li></ul><p class=\"article-body\">Sometimes a rating is given as X, rather than a number. This doesn't mean the product doesn't offer any protection, it instead means it hasn't been tested or assigned a level in that area.</p><h2 class=\"article-sidetitle\">Protection against liquids</h2><p class=\"article-body\">An IP (Ingress Protection) rating tells users exactly how waterproof a product is. The standard was drawn up by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) – a global organisation responsible for setting international standards for electronic devices, including everything from plug points to cameras, portable speakers and smartphones.<p class=\"article-body\">The second digit in the IP rating (the 8 in IP68) refers to the level of protection against liquids - here's what they mean:</p><ul class=\"article-list\"><li>0 - No protection.</li><li>1 - Minimal protection against vertical drops of water, such as very light rain.</li><li>2 - Protected by vertical drops of water when the device is tilted at 15° from its normal position.</li><li>3 - Protection against sprays of water when the device is tilted at 60° from its usual position, including rain.</li><li>4 - Protection from sprays and splashes of water from any direction.</li><li>5 - Protection against water sprayed directly from a low-pressure nozzle measuring 6.3mm, from any direction.</li><li>6 - Protection from high-powered water jets with a 12.5mm nozzle, from any direction, such as a shower.</li><li>7- Protected for up to 1m of immersion for up to 30 minutes, including splashing from a shower or an accidental (and brief) dunking.</li><li>8 - Protection against submersion beyond 1m. May mean that device is hermetically sealed or merely that any water that can get inside will cause no damage.</li></ul><p class=\"article-body\">Somewhat confusingly, just because a device has been rated at level 8 for waterproofing, does not mean it has passed tests for the levels below it. For example, while the iPhone 7 has an iP67 rating meaning it can withstand brief submersion, it hasn't been rated to survive a jet of water (levels 5 and 6). So while it would survive being dropped in the bath, Apple admits the phone should not be taken into the shower. Liquid damage is not covered under warranty.</p><p class=\"article-body\">In contrast, the Sony Xperia ZX Premium has a rating of IP65/68 meaning it can withstand both a shower and a dunking.</p>

//Stephen Hawking

<p class=\"article-body\">Professor Stephen Hawking says he is not alone in believing humans need to find a new planet to live on within 100 years if it is to survive.</p><p class=\"article-body\">As part of the BBC’s new science series Tomorrow’s World, Professor Hawking said he thinks due to climate change, overdue asteroid strikes, epidemics and population growth, humans will need to find a new planet to populate within a single lifetime – revised from the 1,000 year time limit he gave last November.</p><p class=\"article-body\">Speaking at The Royal Society in London ahead of the Starmus IV festival, Professor Hawking said he and others will elaborate on this view at the science and music festival held in Trondheim, Norway.</p><p class=\"article-body\">“I strongly believe we should start seeking alternative planets for possible habitation,” he said. “We are running out of space on earth and we need to break through technological limitations preventing us living elsewhere in the universe.”</p><p class=\"article-body\">“I am not alone in this view and many of my colleagues will make further comments at the Starmus next month.”</p><p class=\"article-body\">Hawking isn't the only one who has advocated for a multi-planet species. SpaceX boss Elon Musk has grand plans to launch space colonies in the next 100-years and Nasa has said its Mars missions could help to put humans permanently on other planets.</p><p class=\"article-body\">Neuroscientist and Nobel Laureate Edvard Moser, who will also be at the Starmus event, said Professor Hawking has emphasised the need for science in society, at a time when communicating science is more important than ever.</p><p class=\"article-body\">“I think what it comes down to is explaining how the data of climate change has been collected and how the scientific process works and how data is tested over and over again and I think it's an educational job.</p><p class=\"article-body\">“I don’t think there’s a single sentence I could say that would change anyone’s mind overnight but I think it's a long term thing, Moser said. “There are many people who don’t take advice from science for granted anymore, however I want to say this is not just an issue about the current president of the United States it's actually a concern in all countries". Since Trump took office in January, his administration has removed climate change policies and references from the Whitehouse website. Thousands of scientists also marched in protest at his policies.</p><p class=\"article-body\">“One example is climate change which is something that scientists have to fight against other types of evidence for a long time so I think you shouldn’t take for granted that science is perceived as the source of the right answer. You have to explain to the public how science works,” he said.</p><p class=\"article-body\">“Science should not be an elitist activity, it is something that should be driven by society for the benefit of society and we should aim for having everyone agree with that.”</p>

//Bungie

<p class=\"article-body\">If there’s anything Bungie wants you to know about Destiny 2 — a sequel to the addictive, ambitious, and oftentimes frustrating online-only shooter — it’s that the game will actually respect your time. During the first gameplay reveal in Los Angeles yesterday, Bungie executives took the stage to outline the substantial quality of life improvements the sequel will introduce to make this happen.</p><p class=\"article-body\">From removing the need to load in and out of one area for different activities to letting players more easily group up with strangers, Bungie is going to great lengths to paint its new installment as a more thoughtful, well-meaning, and accessible video game. “We want Destiny to not feel like work and feel like it’s taking up your life,” says M.E. Chung, a game designer at Bungie who specializes on the series’ social dynamics. “We want it to fit into your life schedule.”</p><p class=\"article-body\">For many hardcore players, the original Destiny sometimes felt like a second job. On top of the grind of daily play and the ever-increasing amount of items to collect, Destiny was hobbled by befuddling design choices and maddening technical constraints. Players complained endlessly about not having enough space for all their gear and weapons, the lack of narrative and cinematic direction, and an almost Kafkaesque progression system. (Ask any longtime player and they can recount horror stories of repetitive materials farming and the nihilistic cruelty of the game’s random number generator.) Destiny spent its first year looking like an extended beta, as Bungie tweaked and changed it constantly in response to player feedback.</p><p class=\"article-body\">The end result was a title that reminded players that their time just might be better spent elsewhere, creating a constant tug-of-war battle between that nagging feeling and the satisfying, dopamine rush of another new piece of loot or a hard-fought victory. For those without a dedicated group of friends to play with, Destiny could feel like an alienating and isolated experience. With all the the window dressing of its social infrastructure stripped away, it was just a series of feedback loops and feeble reward systems laid bare — a pretty-looking gun game with nothing to say.</p><img class=\"article-image\" href="/img/digibytes_102_2.jpg" alt="Destiny screenshot"><p class=\"article-body\">The original Destiny, which could cost upwards of $150 when you factor in expansions and other add-on content, was a fascinating attempt at trying to blend the benefits of a massively multiplayer online game with the nuts and bolts of a first-person shooter. The combination was both a wondrous success and spectacular failure on multiple levels. Even the most diehard players are quick to own up to their complicated relationship with the game. Yet while fans may have endured an emotional rollercoaster of a relationship with Destiny’s creators over the years, the franchise has come out on the other end intact.</p><p class=\"article-body\">Now, Bungie is ready for its second shot. The developer wants Destiny 2 to feel like a fresher, friendlier, and more social game, everything the original was meant to be. “We have a saying, ‘Making it easier to find the fun,’” says Chung. Bungie hopes this extends through every element of the game. The goal is to make Destiny 2 less of a slog designed only for the most dedicated of players, while also being more accessible to people who don’t have a large network of online friends to play with. “There are some people who are going to play every day — one of our lessons is that our players are always going to outpace us,” Chung admits. “But we don’t want players to fall behind.”</p><p class=\"article-body\">This new philosophy appears to have had the biggest impact on the game’s social elements. Destiny 2 will now feature a system called Guided Games, which will let less experienced players opt to play with more skilled members of an official clan. (These clans existed in a minor form in the previous game, through the company’s website, but never as a fully functioning in-game system.)</p><p class=\"article-body\">One of the biggest problems with the initial Destiny was how many of its most challenging and rewarding activities were restricted to premade teams, meaning you couldn’t go in solo and find other strangers to play with. Instead, players formed groups through third-party forums on Reddit, and scores of dedicated Destiny group-finding services popped up elsewhere. Now, players will be able to jump into group activities by selecting a clan that meets their criteria, whether it be a kid-friendly group, one that’s more competitive, one open to female players, or any number of other possibilities.</p><p class=\"article-body\">Chung says the original restrictions in Destiny were an intentional design decision, something Bungie felt was necessary given the toxicity of the game community. The developer didn’t feel comfortable putting strangers into high-stress situations, especially when it could be a young kid and a profanity-loving college student. “It’s funny. You hear about toxicity in lots of different games [today],” she says. “I played online games in my teens and it was just as toxic then,” just with less female players, she adds. Chung says that, as a female gamer, she learned to play without a mic and by using only ambiguous online handles that wouldn’t give away her gender.</p><p class=\"article-body\">It was this kind of toxicity, coupled with how wonky and unfriendly old-school PC server lists were, that moved console shooters toward matchmaking, Chung explains, where you could easily queue into a playlist and choose never to interact with others if you didn’t want to. But that “made you lose the ability to find the people you trust” to play with, she says. Bungie is now trying to find a better balance, after deciding that its initial approach in the first Destiny simply did not work.</p><p class=\"article-body\">Guided Games will hopefully be that system, letting players enjoy features like the six-person raids and three-person “nightfall” strikes by self-selecting a group to be paired with. Of course, the success of this will all depend on how willing clans are to help strangers and take their roles seriously, and whether the logistical and technical challenges involved don’t mean enduring long wait times to find strangers to play with. Bungie says there will be reward systems for clans to help incentivize positivity and openness, but the developer has yet to disclose details on how the system will work.</p><p class=\"article-body\">Chung says that, above all, Destiny 2 is aimed at nurturing the series’ tight-knit community. “We had a hunch about this game being about the community,” she says. Prior to release, Bungie had no idea the Destiny would inspire a 300,000-plus subreddit or real-life meet-ups or dedicated cosplay. That’s not to mention the scores of personal stories about friendships made, family bonds strengthened, and even an in-game marriage proposal. Now — three years later and with a legion of fans who play Destiny as devoutly as some of the longest-running MMOs — it seems clear that without its social fabric, the game would be just another flashy shooter.</p><p class=\"article-body\">Destiny’s entire purpose, Chung adds, is to create virtual obstacles for players to overcome together. “I describe that challenge as the fuel to memories between lifelong friends. I think a lot about games I’ve been playing, when you ask yourself, ‘Why am I doing this?’” she says, ruminating on the hours we spend obsessively collecting virtual goods and toiling away online to blow off steam. “We hope with Destiny they’re saying, ‘I’m spending time with my friends.’ Most people don’t regret the time they spend with their friends.”</p>

//Electric cars

<p class=\"article-body\">Qualcomm has introduced a new system that can charge a car while it's travelling at 'highway speeds'. Called dynamic electric vehicle charging (DEVC), the technology is integrated into a specially-built track, cutting out the need for electric cars to stop at charging stations. The breakthrough could pave the way for the building of more roads capable of charging cars, and an eventual move to other electric vehicles.</p><p class=\"article-body\">Based on the Qualcomm Halo wireless electric vehicle charging technology (WEVC), the DEVC tech can charge two vehicles on the same track simultaneously. What's more, vehicles can pick up charge while travelling forwards and in reverse.</p><p class=\"article-body\">The technology was demonstrated at the 100-metre FABRIC test track at Satory Versailles, France, where the two vehicles were able to charge at up to 20 kilowatts while travelling at high speed.</p><p class=\"article-body\">The pseudo-acronym FABRIC stands for FeAsiBility analysis and development of on-Road chargIng solutions for future electriC vehicles and is a €9 million (£7.6m) project, mostly funded by the European Commission. Built by VEDECOM, the FABRIC test track was fitted with charging tech by Qualcomm, while VEDECOM and Renault worked together to equip two Renault Kangoo vehicles with the receiving part of the technology.</p><p class=\"article-body\">"The installation of one of the world’s first DEVC test platforms has provided us with a unique test facility and we look forward to expanding our expertise with the future testing," said VEDECOM CEO Luc Marbach.</p><p class=\"article-body\">The FABRIC project began in January 2014 and is scheduled to continue until December 2017. The initiative is being undertaken by 25 organisations from nine European countries, including car makers, suppliers, and automotive research groups.</p><p class=\"article-body\">It is hoped the breakthrough in dynamic charging will make electric vehicles a far more attractive option for car users.</p><p class=\"article-body\">"We see dynamic charging as a great vision to further enhance the ease of use of EVs [Electric Vehicles], thus the accessibility of EVs for all," said Eric Feunteun, Electric Vehicle Program Director, Groupe Renault.</p><p class=\"article-body\">The aim of the current project is to investigate how the range of electric cars ban be boosted.</p><p class=\"article-body\">"The combination of a global team of expert engineers and Qualcomm Halo technology, which covers all aspects of WEVC systems, irrespective of the magnetics used, has enabled us to really push the boundaries of the possible and outline our vision for future urban mobility," said Steve Pazol, vice president and general manager for Wireless Charging at Qualcomm.</p>
